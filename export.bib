   abstract = {Objectives The Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score is a new metric to evaluate the diagnostic quality of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate. This study assesses the impact of an intervention, namely a prostate MRI quality training lecture, on the participant's ability to apply PI-QUAL. Methods Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists, physicists, and computer scientists) of varying experience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI all assessed the image quality of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then, they attended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop on MRI quality assessment using the PI-QUAL score. Five scans assessed by the participants were evaluated in the workshop using the PI-QUAL score for teaching purposes. After the course, the same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten scans applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The reference standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by one of the developers of PI-QUAL. Results There was a significant improvement in average area under the curve for the evaluation of image quality from baseline (0.59 [95 % confidence intervals: 0.50-0.66]) to post-teaching (0.96 [0.92-0.98]), an improvement of 0.37 [0.21-0.41] (p < 0.001). Conclusions A teaching course (dedicated lecture + hands-on workshop) on PI-QUAL significantly improved the application of this scoring system to assess the quality of prostate MRI examinations. Key Points • A significant improvement in the application of PI-QUAL for the assessment of prostate MR image quality was observed after an educational intervention. • Appropriate training on image quality can be delivered to those involved in the acquisition and interpretation of prostate MRI. • Further investigation will be needed to understand the impact on improving the acquisition of high-quality diagnostic prostate MR examinations.},

Placing multiple cryo-needles accurately to form an ablation volume that adequately covers the target volume is crucial for better oncological/functional outcomes. This paper presents an MRI-compatible system combining a motorized tilting grid template with insertion depth sensing capabilities, enabling the physician to precisely place the cryo-needles into the desired location. In vivo animal study in a swine model (3 animals) was performed to test the device performance including targeting accuracy and the procedure workflow. The study showed that the insertion depth feedback improved the 3D targeting accuracy when compared to the conventional insertion technique (7.4 mm vs. 11.2 mm, p = 0.04). All three cases achieved full iceball coverage without repositioning the cryo-needles. The results demonstrate the advantages of the motorized tilting mechanism and real-time insertion depth feedback, as well as the feasibility of the proposed workflow for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Objective. Clinical outcomes of transperineal prostate interventions, such as biopsy, thermal ablations, and brachytherapy, depend on accurate needle placement for effectiveness. However, the accurate placement of a long needle, typically 150-200 mm in length, is challenging due to needle deviation induced by needle-tissue interaction. While several approaches for needle trajectory correction have been studied, many of them do not translate well to practical applications due to the use of specialized needles not yet approved for clinical use, or to relying on needle-tissue models that need to be tailored to individual patients. Approach. In this paper, we present a robot-assisted collaborative needle insertion method that only requires an actuated passive needle guide and a conventional needle. The method is designed to assist a physician inserting a needle manually through a needle guide. If the needle is deviated from the intended path, actuators shifts the needle radially in order to steer the needle trajectory and compensate for needle deviation adaptively. The needle guide is controlled by a new data-driven algorithm which does not require a priori information about needle or tissue properties. The method was evaluated in experiments with both in vitro and ex vivo phantoms. Main results. The experiments in ex vivo tissue reported a mean final placement error of 0.36 mm with a reduction of 96.25% of placement error when compared to insertions without the use of assistive correction. Significance. Presented results show that the proposed closed-loop formulation can be successfully used to correct needle deflection during collaborative manual insertion with potential to be easily translated into clinical application.},

   abstract = {Purpose Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transperineal prostate biopsy has been practiced since the early 2000s. The technique often suffers from targeting error due to deviation of the needle as a result of physical interaction between the needle and inhomogeneous tissues. Existing needle guide devices, such as a grid template, do not allow choosing an alternative insertion path to mitigate the deviation because of their limited degree-of-freedom (DoF). This study evaluates how an angulated needle insertion path can reduce needle deviation and improve needle placement accuracy. Methods We extended a robotic needle-guidance device (Smart Template) for in-bore MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy. The new Smart Template has a 4-DoF needle-guiding mechanism allowing a translational range of motion of 65 and 58 mm along the vertical and horizontal axis, and a needle rotational motion around the vertical and horizontal axis and a vertical rotational range of , respectively. We defined a path planning strategy, which chooses between straight and angulated insertion paths depending on the anatomical structures on the potential insertion path. We performed (a) a set of experiments to evaluate the device positioning accuracy outside the MR-bore, and (b) an in vivo experiment to evaluate the improvement of targeting accuracy combining straight and angulated insertions in animal models (swine, ). Results We analyzed 46 in vivo insertions using either straight or angulated insertions paths. The experiment showed that the proposed strategy of selecting straight or angulated insertions based on the subject?s anatomy outperformed the conventional approach of just straight insertions in terms of targeting accuracy (2.4 mm [1.3?3.7] vs 3.9 mm [2.4?5.0] \{Median ); p = 0.041 after the bias correction). Conclusion The in vivo experiment successfully demonstrated that an angulated needle insertion path could improve needle placement accuracy with a path planning strategy that takes account of the subject-specific anatomical structures.},

   abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: There have been multiple investigations defining and reporting the effectiveness of focal cryoablation as a treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer. However, the impact of cryo-needle/probe placement accuracy within the tumor and gland has not been extensively studied. We analyzed how variations in the placement of the cryo-needles, specifically errors leading to incomplete ablation, may affect prostate cancer's resulting cryoablation. Materials and Methods: We performed a study based on isothermal models using Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the impact of needle placement errors on tumor coverage and the probability of positive ablation margin. We modeled the placement error as a Gaussian noise on the cryo-needle position. The analysis used retrospective MRI data of 15 patients with biopsy-proven, unifocal, and MRI visible prostate cancer to calculate the impact of placement error on the volume of the tumor encompassed by the −40°C and −20°C isotherms using one to four cryo-needles. Results: When the standard deviation of the placement error reached 3 mm, the tumor coverage was still above 97% with the −20°C isotherm, and above 81% with the −40°C isotherm using two cryo-needles or more. The probability of positive margin was significantly lower considering the −20°C isotherm (0.04 for three needles) than using the −40°C isotherm (0.66 for three needles). Conclusion: The results indicated that accurate cryo-needle placement is essential for the success of focal cryoablation of prostate cancer. The analysis shows that an admissible targeting error depends on the lethal temperature considered and the number of cryo-needles used.},

   abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men. Prostate interventions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefits from high tissue contrast if compared to other imaging modalities. The Minimally Invasive Robotics In An MRI environment (MIRIAM) robot is an MRI-compatible system able to steer different types of needles towards a point of interest using MRI guidance. However, clinicians can be reluctant to give the robot total control of the intervention. This work integrates a haptic device in the MIRIAM system to allow input from the clinician during the insertion. A shared control architecture is achieved by letting the clinician control the insertion depth via the haptic device, while the robotic system controls the needle orientation. The clinician receives haptic feedback based on the insertion depth and tissue characteristics. Four control laws relating the motion of the master robot (haptic device) to the motion of the slave robot (MIRIAM robot) are presented and evaluated. Quantitative and qualitative results from 20 human subjects demonstrate that the squared-velocity control law is the most suitable option for our application. Additionally, a pre-operative target localization algorithm is presented in order to provide the robot with the target location. The target localization and reconstruction algorithm are validated in phantom and patient images with an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.78. The complete system is validated through experiments by inserting a needle towards a target within the MRI scanner. Four human subjects perform the experiment achieving an average targeting error of 3.4[Formula: see text]mm.},

We performed a pilot study on robot-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy with an emphasis on the in-depth analysis of the needle-tissue interaction in vivo. The data were acquired during in-bore transperineal prostate biopsies in patients using a 4 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) MRI-compatible robot. The anatomical structures in the pelvic area and the needle path were reconstructed from MR images, and quantitatively analyzed. We analyzed each structure individually and also proposed a mathematical model to investigate the influence of those structures in the targeting error using the mixed-model regression. The median targeting error in 188 insertions (27 patients) was 6.3 mm. Both the individual anatomical structure analysis and the mixed-model analysis showed that the deviation resulted from the contact between the needle and the skin as the main source of error. On contrary, needle bending inside the tissue (expressed as needle curvature) did not vary among insertions with targeting errors above and below the average. The analysis indicated that insertions crossing the bulbospongiosus presented a targeting error lower than the average. The mixed-model analysis demonstrated that the distance between the needle guide and the patient skin, the deviation at the entry point, and the path length inside the pelvic diaphragm had a statistically significant contribution to the targeting error (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the errors associated with the elastic contact between the needle and the skin were more prominent than the needle bending along the insertion. Our findings will help to improve the preoperative planning of transperineal prostate biopsies.},

The MR-conditional design of the robot and the needle insertion controller are presented. MR compatibility tests using T2 imaging protocol are performed showing a SNR reduction of 25% when the robot is operational within the MR scanner. Experiments inserting a biopsy needle toward a physical target resulted in an average targeting error of 1.84mm.

Robotic systems have been exploited as the main tool to achieve high accuracy and reliability. However, for reasons of safety and acceptance by the surgical community, keeping the physician tightly in the loop is preferable. Methods: The system uses ultrasound imaging, path planning, and control to compute the desired needle orientation during the insertion and intuitively passes this information to the operator, who teleoperates the motion of the needle's tip. Navigation cues about the computed orientation are provided through haptic and visual feedback to the operator to steer the needle. Results: The targeting accuracy of several co-manipulation strategies were studied in four sets of experiments involving human subjects with clinical backgrounds. Conclusions: Experimental results show that receiving feedback regarding the desired needle orientation improves the targeting accuracy by a factor of 9 with respect to manual insertions.

In this paper, we propose a flexible needle steering algorithm that is able to handle physiological motion disturbances. The system estimates the disturbance using the force information provided by a force sensor placed in contact with the soft-tissue. The system is evaluated through experiments steering a flexible needle towards a physical target into a moving soft-tissue phantom. Three experimental cases with motion disturbances based on clinical procedures in the lung, kidney and heart are used to assess the targeting error. The average targeting error of all 15 experimental trials is 1:05±0:41mm.

This work presents a new three-dimensional flexible needle steering system which integrates an optimal steering control, ultrasound-based needle tracking system, needle deflection model, online needle curvature estimation and offline curvature estimation based on biomechanics properties. The online and the offline curvature estimations are used to update the steering control in real time. The system is evaluated by experiments in gelatin phantoms and biological tissues (chicken breast tissues). The average targeting error in gelatin phantoms is 0.42 ± 0.17 mm, and in biological tissues is 1.63 ± 0.29 mm. The system is able to accurately steer a flexible needle in multi-layer phantoms and biological tissues without performing prior insertions to estimate the maximum needle curvature.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we present a system capable of automatically steering a bevel-tipped flexible needle under ultrasound guidance toward a physical target while avoiding a physical obstacle embedded in gelatin phantoms and biological tissue with curved surfaces. An ultrasound pre-operative scan is performed for three-dimensional (3D) target localization and shape reconstruction. A controller based on implicit force control is developed to align the transducer with curved surfaces to assure the maximum contact area, and thus obtain an image of sufficient quality. We experimentally investigate the effect of needle insertion system parameters such as insertion speed, needle diameter and bevel angle on target motion to adjust the parameters that minimize the target motion during insertion. A fast sampling-based path planner is used to compute and periodically update a feasible path to the target that avoids obstacles. We present experimental results for target reconstruction and needle insertion procedures in gelatin-based phantoms and biological tissue. Mean targeting errors of 1.46. ±. 0.37. mm, 1.29. ±. 0.29. mm and 1.82. ±. 0.58. mm are obtained for phantoms with inclined, curved and combined (inclined and curved) surfaces, respectively, for insertion distance of 86-103. mm. The achieved targeting errors suggest that our approach is sufficient for targeting lesions of 3. mm radius that can be detected using clinical ultrasound imaging systems.},

   abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent image contrast for various types of tissues, making it a suitable choice over other imaging modalities for various image-guided needle interventions. Furthermore, robot-assistance is maturing for surgical procedures such as percutaneous prostate and brain interventions. Although MRI-guided, robot-assisted needle interventions are approaching clinical usage, they are still typically open-loop in nature due to the lack of continuous intraoperative needle tracking. Closed-loop needle-based procedures can improve the accuracy of needle tip placement by correcting the needle trajectory during insertion. This paper proposes a system for robot-assisted, flexible asymmetric-tipped needle interventions under continuous intraoperative MRI guidance. A flexible needle's insertion depth and rotation angle are manipulated by an MRI-compatible robot in the bore of the MRI scanner during continuous multi-planar image acquisition to reach a desired target location. Experiments are performed on gelatin phantoms to assess the accuracy of needle placement into the target location. The system was able to successfully utilize live MR imaging to guide the path of the needle, and results show an average total targeting error of 2.5±0.47mm, with an average in-plane error of 2.09±0.33mm.},

   abstract = {Controlling the interaction between robots and living soft tissues has become an important issue as the number of robotic systems inside the operating room increases. Many researches have been done on force control to help surgeons during medical procedures, such as physiological motion compensation and tele-operation systems with haptic feedback. In order to increase the performance of such controllers, this work presents a novel force control scheme using Active Observer (AOB) based on a viscoelastic interaction model. The control scheme has shown to be stable through theoretical analysis and its performance was evaluated by in vitro experiments. In order to evaluate how the force control scheme behaves under the presence of physiological motion, experiments considering breathing and beating heart disturbances are presented. The proposed control scheme presented a stable behavior in both static and moving environment. The viscoelastic AOB presented a compensation ratio of 87% for the breathing motion and 79% for the beating heart motion.},

   abstract = {Needle insertion procedures are commonly used to treat and to diagnose prostate cancer. Surgical simulation systems can be used to estimate prostate deformation during pre- and intra-operative needle insertion planning. Such systems require a model that can accurately predict the prostate deformation in real time. In this study, we present a prostate model that incorporates the anatomy of the male pelvic region. The model is used to predict the prostate deformation during needle insertion and it is implemented in the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). SOFA simulations are compared with experimental results for two scenarios: indentation and needle insertion. An experimental phantom is developed using anatomically accurate magnetic resonance images and populated with elasticity properties obtained from ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging technique. Markers are placed on the phantom surface to identify the deformation during indentation experiments. The root mean square error (RMSE) obtained in indentation experiments is 0.36 mm. During the needle insertion, the needle tip position is used to validate the model. The SOFA simulation resulted in a RMSE of 0.14 mm. The results of this study demonstrate that SOFA is a feasible option to be used in surgical simulations for pre-operative planning and training.},
