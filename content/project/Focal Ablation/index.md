Focal therapy (FT) is emerging as a promising approach in prostate cancer management, addressing the need for less invasive treatment while reducing over treatment, particularly in low- and intermediate-risk patients. The integration of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and MRI-targeted biopsy has improved patient selection for FT. As patient demand for minimally invasive options grows, FT continues to shape prostate cancer treatment by balancing oncological control with functional preservation. 

Our lab contributes to this evolving field by developing advanced methods for the planning and guidance of FT procedures, enhancing precision and improving patient outcomes.
