AI-driven iceball prediction is emerging as a powerful tool to enhance the precision of focal cryoablation. Traditional planning methods rely heavily on vendor specifications and physician expertise, often leading to suboptimal ablation coverage. While bioheat simulations and finite element modeling have been explored for isotherm prediction, their clinical adoption remains limited due to computational demands and the need for detailed patient-specific data. 

Our lab is actively engaged in multiple projects advancing AI-based solutions for real-time iceball prediction, needle placement optimization, and MRI-guided cryotherapy. By integrating machine learning with intraprocedural imaging, we aim to improve treatment accuracy, enhance workflow efficiency, and support broader clinical adoption of AI-driven focal therapy planning.
