      Research and Development of a robotic system able to identify internal corrosion in ASCR cables used in aerial transmission lines. A magnetic sensor and a robot trolley to run over the ASCR cables were developed. The system was tested in a 500kV live line with great success and a patent was required in the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property. Part of this work was developed during my master in Control Systems and Robotics

#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
