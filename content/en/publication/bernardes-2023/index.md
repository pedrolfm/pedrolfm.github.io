abstract: Objective. Clinical outcomes of transperineal prostate interventions, such
  as biopsy, thermal ablations, and brachytherapy, depend on accurate needle placement
  for effectiveness. However, the accurate placement of a long needle, typically 150-200
  mm in length, is challenging due to needle deviation induced by needle-tissue interaction.
  While several approaches for needle trajectory correction have been studied, many
  of them do not translate well to practical applications due to the use of specialized
  needles not yet approved for clinical use, or to relying on needle-tissue models
  that need to be tailored to individual patients. Approach. In this paper, we present
  a robot-assisted collaborative needle insertion method that only requires an actuated
  passive needle guide and a conventional needle. The method is designed to assist
  a physician inserting a needle manually through a needle guide. If the needle is
  deviated from the intended path, actuators shifts the needle radially in order to
  steer the needle trajectory and compensate for needle deviation adaptively. The
  needle guide is controlled by a new data-driven algorithm which does not require
  a priori information about needle or tissue properties. The method was evaluated
  in experiments with both in vitro and ex vivo phantoms. Main results. The experiments
  in ex vivo tissue reported a mean final placement error of 0.36 mm with a reduction
  of 96.25% of placement error when compared to insertions without the use of assistive
  correction. Significance. Presented results show that the proposed closed-loop formulation
  can be successfully used to correct needle deflection during collaborative manual
  insertion with potential to be easily translated into clinical application.
