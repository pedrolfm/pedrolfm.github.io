abstract: Flexible bevel-tipped needle steering has been an active research topic
  since the last decade. However, most of the work presented so far performs flexible
  needle steering in static phantoms or non-static virtual environments. The insertion
  of flexible bevel-tipped needles into soft-tissue subjected to motion disturbances
  is still an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a flexible needle steering
  algorithm that is able to handle physiological motion disturbances. The system estimates
  the disturbance using the force information provided by a force sensor placed in
  contact with the soft-tissue. The system is evaluated through experiments steering
  a flexible needle towards a physical target into a moving soft-tissue phantom. Three
  experimental cases with motion disturbances based on clinical procedures in the
  lung, kidney and heart are used to assess the targeting error. The average targeting
  error of all 15 experimental trials is 1:05±0:41mm. Our results demonstrate the
  ability of the proposed system to compensate for motion disturbances applied to
  the soft-tissue phantom.
