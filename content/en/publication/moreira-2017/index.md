abstract: Early prostate cancer detection and treatment are of major importance to
  reduce mortality rate. magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides images of the prostate
  where an early stage lesion can be visualized. The use of robotic systems for MR-guided
  interventions in the prostate allows us to improve the clinical outcomes of procedures
  such as biopsy and brachytherapy. This work presents a novel MR-conditional robot
  for prostate interventions. The minimally invasive robotics in an magnetic resonance
  imaging environment (MIRIAM) robot has 9 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) used to steer
  and fire a biopsy needle. The needle guide is positioned against the perineum by
  a 5 DoF parallel robot driven by piezoelectric motors. A 4 DoF needle driver inserts,
  rotates and fires the needle during the procedure. Piezoelectric motors are used
  to insert and rotate the needle, while pneumatic actuation is used to fire the needle.
  The MR-conditional design of the robot and the needle insertion controller are presented.
  MR compatibility tests using T2 imaging protocol are performed showing a SNR reduction
  of 25% when the robot is operational within the MR scanner. Experiments inserting
  a biopsy needle toward a physical target resulted in an average targeting error
  of 1.84mm. Our study presents a novel MR-conditional robot and demonstrated the
  ability to perform MR-guided needle-based interventions in soft-tissue phantoms.
  Moreover, the image distortion analysis indicates that no visible image deterioration
  is induced by the robot.
