abstract: 'Background and objective: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies
  for prostate cancer diagnosis can be performed as a transperineal biopsy (TP-Bx),
  yet its comparative performance with transrectal biopsy (TR-Bx) remains uncertain.
  We evaluated the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) by
  TP-Bx and TR-Bx according to lesion size and location using Prostate Imaging Reporting
  & Data System (PI-RADS) criteria. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed biopsy-naïve
  patients who underwent MRI-guided prostate biopsies at our institution. TR-Bx was
  performed using MRI-ultrasound fusion in the urology clinic, while TP-Bx utilized
  an MRI in-bore technique in the radiology department. Lesions were stratified by
  PI-RADS-defined score, location, and size. Results: Among 200 patients (100 TP-Bx,
  100 TR-Bx), 276 PI-RADS score 3 to 5 lesions were biopsied (141 TP-Bx, 135 TR-Bx).
  Overall csPCa detection did not differ significantly between TP-Bx and TR-Bx (28%
  vs. 38%; OR = 1.5, CI = 0.9–2.6, P = 0.12). However, TR-Bx detected significantly
  more csPCa in non-apical peripheral zone (PZ) lesions compared to TP-Bx [45% (36/80)
  vs. 29% (21/73), adjusted OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.29–16.4, P = 0.019], particularly
  for small (diameter ≤1 cm) lesions (35% [16/46] vs. 12% [5/42], adjusted OR = 8.06,
  95% CI = 1.45–44.7, P = 0.017). No significant difference was observed for larger
  lesions (diameter >1 cm). Conclusions: Overall csPCa detection rates were comparable
  between TP-Bx and TR-Bx, with no statistically significant difference. However,
  TR-Bx demonstrated superior detection in small non-apical PZ lesions, suggesting
  an anatomic and size-dependent advantage. These exploratory findings support further
  prospective studies to refine MRI-targeted biopsy protocols using PI-RADS-defined
  lesion characteristics to inform personalized biopsy strategies.'
