abstract: 'Purpose: Focal cryoablation is an effective treatment for localized and
  recurrent prostate cancer, offering reduced risks of side effects. However, treatment
  success depends on physician experience, as intraprocedural adjustments are required
  due to needle deflection. To determine whether an image-guided adaptive treatment
  strategy could reduce the required years of experience, we developed Image-guided
  Adaptive Cryotherapy (ImAC). We hypothesize that ImAC can be successfully implemented
  in MRI-guided cryotherapy to optimize needle placement. To test this hypothesis,
  we conducted a retrospective study comparing the performance of an experienced physician
  to that of ImAC. Methods: ImAC was designed to calculate the best subsequent needle
  location while accounting for needle deflection and iceball formation. After development,
  its performance was evaluated by simulating 21 needle insertions. Results: We found
  that ImAC achieved a higher median minimum ablation margin than the physician (5.0
  vs 3.4 mm) while maintaining similar needle placement adjustments (± 7.5 mm). Conclusion:
  These results suggest that ImAC has the potential to optimize needle placement and
  may reduce the years of experience required for effective cryoablation.'
