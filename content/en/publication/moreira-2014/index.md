abstract: Controlling the interaction between robots and living soft tissues has become
  an important issue as the number of robotic systems inside the operating room increases.
  Many researches have been done on force control to help surgeons during medical
  procedures, such as physiological motion compensation and tele-operation systems
  with haptic feedback. In order to increase the performance of such controllers,
  this work presents a novel force control scheme using Active Observer (AOB) based
  on a viscoelastic interaction model. The control scheme has shown to be stable through
  theoretical analysis and its performance was evaluated by in vitro experiments.
  In order to evaluate how the force control scheme behaves under the presence of
  physiological motion, experiments considering breathing and beating heart disturbances
  are presented. The proposed control scheme presented a stable behavior in both static
  and moving environment. The viscoelastic AOB presented a compensation ratio of 87%
  for the breathing motion and 79% for the beating heart motion.
