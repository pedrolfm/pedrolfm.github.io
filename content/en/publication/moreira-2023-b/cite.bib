 abstract = {MR-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer has often been selected as a minimally-invasive treatment option. Placing multiple cryo-needles accurately to form an ablation volume that adequately covers the target volume is crucial for better oncological/functional outcomes. This paper presents an MRI-compatible system combining a motorized tilting grid template with insertion depth sensing capabilities, enabling the physician to precisely place the cryo-needles into the desired location. In vivo animal study in a swine model (3 animals) was performed to test the device performance including targeting accuracy and the procedure workflow. The study showed that the insertion depth feedback improved the 3D targeting accuracy when compared to the conventional insertion technique (7.4 mm vs. 11.2 mm, p = 0.04). All three cases achieved full iceball coverage without repositioning the cryo-needles. The results demonstrate the advantages of the motorized tilting mechanism and real-time insertion depth feedback, as well as the feasibility of the proposed workflow for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.},
