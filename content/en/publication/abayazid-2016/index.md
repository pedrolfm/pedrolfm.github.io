abstract: "Background: A teleoperation system for bevel-tipped flexible needle steering\
  \ has been evaluated. Robotic systems have been exploited as the main tool to achieve\
  \ high accuracy and reliability. However, for reasons of safety and acceptance by\
  \ the surgical community, keeping the physician tightly in the loop is preferable.\
  \ Methods: The system uses ultrasound imaging, path planning, and control to compute\
  \ the desired needle orientation during the insertion and intuitively passes this\
  \ information to the operator, who teleoperates the motion of the needle's tip.\
  \ Navigation cues about the computed orientation are provided through haptic and\
  \ visual feedback to the operator to steer the needle. Results: The targeting accuracy\
  \ of several co-manipulation strategies were studied in four sets of experiments\
  \ involving human subjects with clinical backgrounds. Conclusions: Experimental\
  \ results show that receiving feedback regarding the desired needle orientation\
  \ improves the targeting accuracy by a factor of 9 with respect to manual insertions.\
