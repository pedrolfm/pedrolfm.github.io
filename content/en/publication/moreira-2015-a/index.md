abstract: Needle-based procedures are commonly performed during minimally invasive
  surgery for treatment and diagnosis. Accurate needle tip placement is important
  for the success of the procedures. Misplacement of the needle tip might cause unsuccessful
  treatment or misdiagnosis. Robot-assisted needle insertion systems have been developed
  in order to steer flexible bevel-tipped needles. However, current systems depend
  on the information of maximum needle curvature, which is estimated by performing
  prior insertions. This work presents a new three-dimensional flexible needle steering
  system which integrates an optimal steering control, ultrasound-based needle tracking
  system, needle deflection model, online needle curvature estimation and offline
  curvature estimation based on biomechanics properties. The online and the offline
  curvature estimations are used to update the steering control in real time. The
  system is evaluated by experiments in gelatin phantoms and biological tissues (chicken
  breast tissues). The average targeting error in gelatin phantoms is 0.42 ± 0.17 mm,
  and in biological tissues is 1.63 ± 0.29 mm. The system is able to accurately steer
  a flexible needle in multi-layer phantoms and biological tissues without performing
  prior insertions to estimate the maximum needle curvature.
