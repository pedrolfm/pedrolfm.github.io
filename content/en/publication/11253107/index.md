abstract: The transperineal approach in prostate interventions is increasingly favored
  for its lower infection risk and enhanced targeting accuracy. However, its precision
  can be affected by factors such as needle deflection, prostate deformation, and
  operator variability. Numerous studies have proposed models of needle deflection
  based on needle tip orientation. However, we hypothesize that anatomical location
  of the prostate cancer has a more significant influence on the direction of needle
  deflection than the needle tip orientation of clinically available needles. To test
  the hypothesis, we analyzed data from 231 in-vivo, transperineal, robot-assisted
  MRI-guided prostate biopsies using a mixed-effects logistic regression model to
  examine the association between needle tip orientation, the anatomical location
  of the prostate target and the resulting direction of needle deflection. The analysis
  shows that the needle tip orientation is not a significant predictor of needle deviation
  direction, while the anatomical location of the prostate targeted during each insertion
  appeared as a significant predictor of deflection direction (p < 0.001, OR = 10.89).
  We conclude that the anatomical location is a key determinant of needle deflection,
  while needle tip orientation has minimal impact. These results provide critical
  insights into the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction, potentially informing
  strategies to improve targeting accuracy in transperineal prostate interventions.
