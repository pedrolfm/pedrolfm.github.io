 abstract = {Robots have been found to be a useful tool in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided intervention. The utility of robots in MRI-guided therapy ranges from aid for precision targeting to high-dexterity surgical tools to improve or even enable new MRI-guided therapy options. The objective of this article is to review the technical aspects of robotics in MRI-guided interventions, highlight the role of MRI robots in prostate interventions, and finally discuss the future contribution of emerging robotics technology useful in MRI-guided intervention.},
