Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) affects approximately 6.1 million individuals worldwide and has witnessed a rapid rise in incidence over the past two decades. Bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has emerged as a well-established and effective surgical intervention for advanced PD. This intricate procedure involves the implantation of electrodes within the STN, connected to a pulse generator, aiming to modulate neural activity and alleviate symptoms. The precision of DBS electrode placement within the STN is paramount for the procedure's success.

Our lab is collaborating with AiM Medical Robotics to advance the translation of their MRI-compatible robot into real-world clinical applications.
