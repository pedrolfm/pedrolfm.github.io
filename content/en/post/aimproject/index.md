I’m pleased to share that we’ve been working with AiM Medical Robotics to initiate the first studies using their neurosurgical device. This initial effort focuses on hashtag safety and hashtag workflow integration, supporting a careful and structured translation of the technology into the clinical environment.

This collaboration reflects our experience in conducting industry-sponsored research while maintaining rigorous scientific, clinical, and operational standards. I’d like to extend a special thank you to the Department of Radiology and the National Center for Advanced Technologies for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT) for their outstanding support, without which this work would not be possible.

We look forward to working closely with Gregory Fischer and the Medical Robotics team as this study moves forward.
