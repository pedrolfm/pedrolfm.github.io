Excited to share that I will be presenting the work of my amazing former student intern **Nayani Modugula**, "Leveraging Automation for Adaptive Planning in MRI-Guided Prostate Cancer Focal Cryoablation," at the ISMRM Annual meeting in Honolulu!

This project explores how automation can enhance treatment planning for prostate cancer, improving precision and adaptability in MRI-guided focal cryoablation.

Looking forward to great discussions at ISMRM. See you in Honolulu!

A huge thank you to the Department of Radiology (BWH) for supporting this work through the pilot grant!
