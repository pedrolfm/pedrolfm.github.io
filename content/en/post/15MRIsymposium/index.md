The National Center for Advanced Technologies for Image Guided Therapy is excited to share that the 15th Interventional MRI Symposium — a premier meeting on MRI-guided interventions — will be returning to Boston this fall! 

This Symposium brings together clinicians, researchers, engineers, and industry leaders from around the world to:
 - Explore the latest advances in interventional MRI technology and clinical practice
 - Present cutting-edge research and innovations
 - Network with international colleagues across multiple disciplines
 - Advance the field of MRI-guided diagnosis and therapy

The event will be held at the iconic Liberty Hotel in Boston’s historic Beacon Hill — a vibrant setting for scientific exchange and collaboration. 

Hope to see you there!
