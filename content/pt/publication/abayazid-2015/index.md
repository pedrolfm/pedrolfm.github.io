abstract: In this paper, we present a system capable of automatically steering a bevel-tipped
  flexible needle under ultrasound guidance toward a physical target while avoiding
  a physical obstacle embedded in gelatin phantoms and biological tissue with curved
  surfaces. An ultrasound pre-operative scan is performed for three-dimensional (3D)
  target localization and shape reconstruction. A controller based on implicit force
  control is developed to align the transducer with curved surfaces to assure the
  maximum contact area, and thus obtain an image of sufficient quality. We experimentally
  investigate the effect of needle insertion system parameters such as insertion speed,
  needle diameter and bevel angle on target motion to adjust the parameters that minimize
  the target motion during insertion. A fast sampling-based path planner is used to
  compute and periodically update a feasible path to the target that avoids obstacles.
  We present experimental results for target reconstruction and needle insertion procedures
  in gelatin-based phantoms and biological tissue. Mean targeting errors of 1.46.
  ±. 0.37. mm, 1.29. ±. 0.29. mm and 1.82. ±. 0.58. mm are obtained for phantoms with
  inclined, curved and combined (inclined and curved) surfaces, respectively, for
  insertion distance of 86-103. mm. The achieved targeting errors suggest that our
  approach is sufficient for targeting lesions of 3. mm radius that can be detected
  using clinical ultrasound imaging systems.
