abstract: While the interaction between a needle and the surrounding tissue is known
  to cause a significant targeting error in prostate biopsy leading to false-negative
  results, few studies have demonstrated how it impacts in the actual procedure. We
  performed a pilot study on robot-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy with an emphasis
  on the in-depth analysis of the needle-tissue interaction in vivo. The data were
  acquired during in-bore transperineal prostate biopsies in patients using a 4 degrees-of-freedom
  (DoF) MRI-compatible robot. The anatomical structures in the pelvic area and the
  needle path were reconstructed from MR images, and quantitatively analyzed. We analyzed
  each structure individually and also proposed a mathematical model to investigate
  the influence of those structures in the targeting error using the mixed-model regression.
  The median targeting error in 188 insertions (27 patients) was 6.3 mm. Both the
  individual anatomical structure analysis and the mixed-model analysis showed that
  the deviation resulted from the contact between the needle and the skin as the main
  source of error. On contrary, needle bending inside the tissue (expressed as needle
  curvature) did not vary among insertions with targeting errors above and below the
  average. The analysis indicated that insertions crossing the bulbospongiosus presented
  a targeting error lower than the average. The mixed-model analysis demonstrated
  that the distance between the needle guide and the patient skin, the deviation at
  the entry point, and the path length inside the pelvic diaphragm had a statistically
  significant contribution to the targeting error (p < 0.05). Our results indicate
  that the errors associated with the elastic contact between the needle and the skin
  were more prominent than the needle bending along the insertion. Our findings will
  help to improve the preoperative planning of transperineal prostate biopsies.
