abstract: 'Needle insertion procedures are commonly used to treat and to diagnose
  prostate cancer. Surgical simulation systems can be used to estimate prostate deformation
  during pre- and intra-operative needle insertion planning. Such systems require
  a model that can accurately predict the prostate deformation in real time. In this
  study, we present a prostate model that incorporates the anatomy of the male pelvic
  region. The model is used to predict the prostate deformation during needle insertion
  and it is implemented in the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). SOFA
  simulations are compared with experimental results for two scenarios: indentation
  and needle insertion. An experimental phantom is developed using anatomically accurate
  magnetic resonance images and populated with elasticity properties obtained from
  ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse imaging technique. Markers are
  placed on the phantom surface to identify the deformation during indentation experiments.
  The root mean square error (RMSE) obtained in indentation experiments is 0.36 mm.
  During the needle insertion, the needle tip position is used to validate the model.
  The SOFA simulation resulted in a RMSE of 0.14 mm. The results of this study demonstrate
  that SOFA is a feasible option to be used in surgical simulations for pre-operative
  planning and training.'
