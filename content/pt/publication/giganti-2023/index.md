abstract: "Objectives The Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score is a new metric
  to evaluate the diagnostic quality of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) of the prostate. This study assesses the impact of an intervention, namely
  a prostate MRI quality training lecture, on the participant's ability to apply PI-QUAL.
  Methods Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists, physicists, and computer
  scientists) of varying experience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI all assessed
  the image quality of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then,
  they attended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop on MRI quality
  assessment using the PI-QUAL score. Five scans assessed by the participants were
  evaluated in the workshop using the PI-QUAL score for teaching purposes. After the
  course, the same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten scans
  applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic
  analysis. The reference standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by one of the developers
  of PI-QUAL. Results There was a significant improvement in average area under the
  curve for the evaluation of image quality from baseline (0.59 [95 % confidence intervals:
  0.50-0.66]) to post-teaching (0.96 [0.92-0.98]), an improvement of 0.37 [0.21-0.41]
  (p < 0.001). Conclusions A teaching course (dedicated lecture + hands-on workshop)
  on PI-QUAL significantly improved the application of this scoring system to assess
  the quality of prostate MRI examinations. Key Points • A significant improvement
  in the application of PI-QUAL for the assessment of prostate MR image quality was
  observed after an educational intervention. • Appropriate training on image quality
  can be delivered to those involved in the acquisition and interpretation of prostate
  MRI. • Further investigation will be needed to understand the impact on improving
  the acquisition of high-quality diagnostic prostate MR examinations."
