abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent image contrast for various
  types of tissues, making it a suitable choice over other imaging modalities for
  various image-guided needle interventions. Furthermore, robot-assistance is maturing
  for surgical procedures such as percutaneous prostate and brain interventions. Although
  MRI-guided, robot-assisted needle interventions are approaching clinical usage,
  they are still typically open-loop in nature due to the lack of continuous intraoperative
  needle tracking. Closed-loop needle-based procedures can improve the accuracy of
  needle tip placement by correcting the needle trajectory during insertion. This
  paper proposes a system for robot-assisted, flexible asymmetric-tipped needle interventions
  under continuous intraoperative MRI guidance. A flexible needle's insertion depth
  and rotation angle are manipulated by an MRI-compatible robot in the bore of the
  MRI scanner during continuous multi-planar image acquisition to reach a desired
  target location. Experiments are performed on gelatin phantoms to assess the accuracy
  of needle placement into the target location. The system was able to successfully
  utilize live MR imaging to guide the path of the needle, and results show an average
  total targeting error of 2.5±0.47mm, with an average in-plane error of 2.09±0.33mm.
