abstract: MR-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer has often been selected
  as a minimally-invasive treatment option. Placing multiple cryo-needles accurately
  to form an ablation volume that adequately covers the target volume is crucial for
  better oncological/functional outcomes. This paper presents an MRI-compatible system
  combining a motorized tilting grid template with insertion depth sensing capabilities,
  enabling the physician to precisely place the cryo-needles into the desired location.
  In vivo animal study in a swine model (3 animals) was performed to test the device
  performance including targeting accuracy and the procedure workflow. The study showed
  that the insertion depth feedback improved the 3D targeting accuracy when compared
  to the conventional insertion technique (7.4 mm vs. 11.2 mm, p = 0.04). All three
  cases achieved full iceball coverage without repositioning the cryo-needles. The
  results demonstrate the advantages of the motorized tilting mechanism and real-time
  insertion depth feedback, as well as the feasibility of the proposed workflow for
  MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.
