abstract: Robots have been found to be a useful tool in magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI)-guided intervention. The utility of robots in MRI-guided therapy ranges from
  aid for precision targeting to high-dexterity surgical tools to improve or even
  enable new MRI-guided therapy options. The objective of this article is to review
  the technical aspects of robotics in MRI-guided interventions, highlight the role
  of MRI robots in prostate interventions, and finally discuss the future contribution
  of emerging robotics technology useful in MRI-guided intervention.
