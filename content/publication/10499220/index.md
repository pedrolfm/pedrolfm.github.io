abstract: Needle insertion using flexible bevel-tip needles is a common minimally
  invasive surgical technique for prostate cancer interventions. Flexible, asymmetric
  bevel-tip needles enable physicians for complex needle steering techniques to avoid
  sensitive anatomical structures during needle insertion. For accurate placement
  of the needle, predicting the trajectory of these needles intraoperatively would
  greatly reduce the need for frequently needle reinsertions, thus improving patient
  comfort and positive outcomes. However, predicting the trajectory of the needle
  during insertion is a complex task that has yet to be solved due to random needleâ€“tissue
  interactions. In this article, we present and validate, for the first time, a hybrid
  deep learning and model-based approach to handle the intraoperative needle shape
  prediction problem through leveraging a validated Lie-group theoretic model for
  needle shape representation. Furthermore, we present a novel self-supervised learning
  (SSL) and method in conjunction with the Lie-group shape model for training these
  networks in the absence of data, enabling further refinement of these networks with
  transfer learning (TL). Needle shape prediction was performed in single-layer and
  double-layer homogeneous phantom tissue for C- and S-shaped needle insertions. Our
  method demonstrates an average root-mean-square prediction error of 1.03 mm over
  a dataset containing approximately 3000 prediction samples with the maximum prediction
  steps of 110 mm.
