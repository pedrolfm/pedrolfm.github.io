abstract: Rationale and Objectives Focal therapies have emerged as minimally invasive
  alternatives for patients with localized low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) and those
  with postradiation recurrence. Among the available focal treatment methods for PCa,
  cryoablation offers several technical advantages, including the visibility of the
  boundaries of frozen tissue on the intraprocedural images, access to anterior lesions,
  and the proven ability to treat postradiation recurrence. However, predicting the
  final volume of the frozen tissue is challenging as it depends on several patient-specific
  factors, such as proximity to heat sources and thermal properties of the prostatic
  tissue. Materials and Methods This paper presents a convolutional neural network
  model based on 3D-Unet to predict the frozen isotherm boundaries (iceball) resultant
  from a given a cryo-needle placement. Intraprocedural magnetic resonance images
  acquired during 38 cases of focal cryoablation of PCa were retrospectively used
  to train and validate the model. The model accuracy was assessed and compared against
  a vendor-provided geometrical model, which is used as a guideline in routine procedures.
  Results The mean Dice Similarity Coefficient using the proposed model was 0.79±0.08
  (mean+SD) vs 0.72±0.06 using the geometrical model (P<.001). Conclusion The model
  provided an accurate iceball boundary prediction in less than 0.4second and has
  proven its feasibility to be implemented in an intraprocedural planning algorithm.
