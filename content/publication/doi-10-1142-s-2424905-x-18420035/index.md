abstract: ' Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death in men. Prostate
  interventions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefits from high tissue contrast
  if compared to other imaging modalities. The Minimally Invasive Robotics In An MRI
  environment (MIRIAM) robot is an MRI-compatible system able to steer different types
  of needles towards a point of interest using MRI guidance. However, clinicians can
  be reluctant to give the robot total control of the intervention. This work integrates
  a haptic device in the MIRIAM system to allow input from the clinician during the
  insertion. A shared control architecture is achieved by letting the clinician control
  the insertion depth via the haptic device, while the robotic system controls the
  needle orientation. The clinician receives haptic feedback based on the insertion
  depth and tissue characteristics. Four control laws relating the motion of the master
  robot (haptic device) to the motion of the slave robot (MIRIAM robot) are presented
  and evaluated. Quantitative and qualitative results from 20 human subjects demonstrate
  that the squared-velocity control law is the most suitable option for our application.
  Additionally, a pre-operative target localization algorithm is presented in order
  to provide the robot with the target location. The target localization and reconstruction
  algorithm are validated in phantom and patient images with an average dice similarity
  coefficient (DSC) of 0.78. The complete system is validated through experiments
  by inserting a needle towards a target within the MRI scanner. Four human subjects
  perform the experiment achieving an average targeting error of 3.4mm. '
